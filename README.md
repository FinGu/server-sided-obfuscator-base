# server sided obfuscator base
 this is a server sided obfuscator base, where you login, select the options, upload the file to the server and it obfuscates it

 the obfuscator used in this project is ConfuserEx, the authentication service is cauth.me
 
 please contact me in case of issues :D
 
 to do ->
```
use ajax for the form upload
```
done ->
```
added support for file dependencies, drop the exe ( must be a single exe ) and the dependencies in a zip file to upload
the confuser ex console output is saved together with the exe in a zip file after the obfuscation (dependencies are added too)
